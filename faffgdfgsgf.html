I think im never gonna be "fine" again.. My parents hate me and only talk to me when they need to say a word, they dont even care about me to the point where I barely eat or drink, I can't even go 1 hour being happy, everything I enjoy just makes me into tears when I stop doing it, and the worst part is I have to act fine to everyone even though I literally feel like im about to cry.. I barely go out and I only do it when i really need to, I'm just stuck in a room with nothing to do apart from things that end up making me so upset to the point where I have a mental breakdown.. It doesn't help that my bullies from school are making it worse, one of them who used to call me a mistake somehow found my Telegram.. I get talked behind my back by my parents and I LITERALLY HEAR THEM TALKING SHIT ABOUT ME, apparently I will never grow up when they're the ones who never showed me any care to teach me how to do basic house jobs.. if I ever meet anyone I love irl, I'm going to be a useless fuck.
